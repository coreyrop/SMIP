# SMIP

We are working to create an educational program that will be used to help students learn how to program in MIPS code. We are using the pyspim code base to run spim through python.

# OS REQUIREMENTS:
- Linux
- UNIX (MacOS)

# Required Python Packages:
- tkinter
- openpyxl
- pexpect

# Other Software Requirements:
- SPIM 

# INSTRUCTIONS:
- Download our repository.
- Change directory to SMIP/.
(May need to rename directory name to SMIP if named otherwise i.e. SMIP-{branch}.  It will not work otherwise.)
- Execute "python3 Main.py".
